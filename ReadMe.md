Corona to Marmalade Quick Mapper and Example
============================================

An set of mapping lua files and the EggBreaker simple example game from *Corona* to
demonstrate mapping Corona code to *Marmalade Quick* automatically.

Porting is all done via addition of new lua files that map Corona calls to Quick
equivalents. Original code is not changed at all apart from currently the movieclip
functionality is replaced by simple image loading. That was partly working but buggy -
should be easy to fix.

Mapping is done largely with a combination of metatable overloads (__index and
__newindex) and also manually caching functions and calling intermediate ones in their
place.

In general, *objects* are tables with Quick nodes inside them and metatable redirecting
indexing to the node (or usually its own metatables!)

I had to rebuild Quick internals to add setBodyType() to QPhysicsNodeProps.h/cpp
This code will crash without that change. Basically copy the files in /Quick-fixes/ to
MARMALADE/modules/third_party/openquick/include (and source) and run openquick_tolua to
rebuild bindings. I'll request that function gets added to official version.


**Things to note:**

- PostCollision seems to work differently. Called early in Corona but takes ages in Quick.
  Might be waiting till no objects are touching at all!
- Text support is minimal. Doesn't support system fonts or font sizes.
- The porting layer mostly supports things this example needed. I added some useful unused
  code here and there, but it needs lots of work to support other games. A good proof of
  concept and easy to expand.


**Original game description:**

A simplified "Crush the Castle" game demo, where objects have internal listeners for
collision events.
